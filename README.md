# Forward
When i was designing this theme i create it for myself. i noticed how simplicity is what drives us forward, so i removed the things that aren't needed, and made everything as simple, straight-forward & stylish as possible.

This theme is inspired by VS Code. it's fast, focused, and prioritizes utility over styling, while still looking stylish! so that i can focus on what matters most: my writings.

It has a modular-based setup so you can toggle your own personal settings, as i believe the tools we create are most useful when they can shape towards our needs.
move froward, always
